Unequal match’d,<br>   Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;<br>   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br>   Th’unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br>   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br>   Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash<br>   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,<br>   Which was declining on the milky head<br>   Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick.<br>   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,<br>   And like a neutral to his will and matter,<br>   Did nothing.<br>   But as we often see against some storm,<br>   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br>   The bold winds speechless, and the orb below<br>   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder<br>   Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus’ pause,<br>   Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,<br>  </em></p></div> </div>
