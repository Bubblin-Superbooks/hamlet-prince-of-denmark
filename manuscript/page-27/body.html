Together with remembrance of ourselves.  
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,  
Th’imperial jointress to this warlike state,  
Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy,  
With one auspicious and one dropping eye,  
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,  
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,  
Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d  
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.  
Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras,  
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,  
Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death  
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,  
Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,  
He hath not fail’d to pester us with message,  
Importing the surrender of those lands
