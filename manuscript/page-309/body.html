He hath much land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess; ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.</p><p>OSRIC.<br>Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.</p><p>HAMLET.<br>I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for the head.</p><p>OSRIC.<br>I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.</p><p>HAMLET.<br>No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.</p><p>OSRIC.<br>It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</p></div> </div>
