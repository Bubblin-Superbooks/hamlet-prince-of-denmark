<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">fires,<br>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br>Are burnt and purg’d away. But that I am forbid<br>To tell the secrets of my prison-house,<br>I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br>Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood,<br>Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,<br>Thy knotted and combined locks to part,<br>And each particular hair to stand on end<br>Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.<br>But this eternal blazon must not be<br>To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!  
If thou didst ever thy dear father love—</p><p>HAMLET.<br>O God!</p><p>GHOST.<br>Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p></div> </div>
