<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>POLONIUS.<br>What said he?</p><p>OPHELIA.<br>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;<br>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;<br>And with his other hand thus o’er his brow,<br>He falls to such perusal of my face<br>As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so,<br>At last,—a little shaking of mine arm,<br>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,<br>He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound<br>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br>And end his being. That done, he lets me go,<br>And with his head over his shoulder turn’d<br>He seem’d to find his way without his eyes,<br>For out o’ doors he went without their help,<br>And to the last bended their light on me.</p></div> </div>
